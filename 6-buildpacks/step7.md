# Save your changes

You will need the new files you've created for the step ahead. In this step you will push your changes to your GitHub repo.
Note that `git push` will need a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) as password to authenticate.

```
git add -A
git commit -m 'Changes from the Buildpacks scenario'
git push origin master
