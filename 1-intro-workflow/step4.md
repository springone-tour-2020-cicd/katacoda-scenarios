# Save your changes

You will need your repo and the new files you've created for the labs ahead. In this step you will fork the sample repo into your own GitHub account and save your changes.

## Fork the GitHub repo and push your changes

Use the `hub` CLI to fork the sample repo and push your changes to GitHub.
You will need your GitHub access token to authenticate against GitHub.

```
hub fork --remote-name origin
git commit -am 'changes from scenario 1'
git push origin master
```{{execute}}

You are now ready to proceed with the other scenarios in this course.
