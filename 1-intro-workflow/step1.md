# Prepare environment

Objective:
Prepare your local environment.

In this step, you will:
- Validate that the environment is initialized
- Set env vars with your GitHub and Docker Hub namespaces

## Validate environment initialization

Please wait until `Environment ready!` appears in the terminal window.

## Set environment variables

Your GitHub namespace (user or org name) will be needed in this scenario. For convenience, copy and paste the following environment variable to the terminal window, then append your GitHub namespace:

```
# Fill this in with your GitHub username or org
GITHUB_NS=
```{{copy}}

Your Docker Hub namespace (user or org name) will be needed in this scenario. For convenience, copy and paste the following environment variable to the terminal window, then append your GitHub namespace:

```
# Fill this in with your GitHub username or org
IMG_NS=
```{{copy}}
