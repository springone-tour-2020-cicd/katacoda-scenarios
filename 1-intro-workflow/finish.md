In this scenario, you set up two repositories in GitHub:
- app source code
- ops files

You also built images using Dockerfile, pushed images to Docker Hub, and deployed and tested the app in Kubernetes.

You manually ran through the process of an initial build & deploy as well as deployment of a code update. Now that you understand the manual workflow, let's explore ways to automate it.

As we automate the process in the subsequent scenarios, you will also see how the process can work at scale and over time.
