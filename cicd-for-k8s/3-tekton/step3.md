# Executing a simple Task

Let's create an echo Task that will simply print 'hello world' to the console.

The echo task uses the image `ubuntu` and then simply executes the command `echo hello world`.

## Install the task definition

Use `kubectl` to install the task definition into the cluster.

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: echo-hello-world
spec:
  steps:
    - name: echo
      image: ubuntu
      command:
        - echo
      args:
        - "hello world"
EOF
```{{execute}}


You can list the installed tasks in the cluster using the `tkn` CLI.
```
tkn task list
```{{execute}}


More information about the task can be obtained using the `describe` command.
```
tkn tasks describe echo-hello-world
```{{execute}}


## Execute the task

To execute this task directly, we can use the `tkn` CLI or create a `TaskRun` resource in a YAML file.
We will create the `TaskRun` resource using a YAML file.

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: echo-hello-world-task-run
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: echo-hello-world
EOF
```{{execute}}

There isn't anything that is customizing the task, so it is just referencing the `echo-hello-world` task.
You can view the other configuration options for a `TaskRun` in the [reference documentation.](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/v0.13.2/docs/taskruns.md)

Now let's get a description of the `TaskRun` that was created.

```
tkn taskrun describe echo-hello-world-task-run
```{{execute}}


You should see in the last part of the output of this command the status of the pod that is running the echo command


```
ðŸ¦¶ Steps

 NAME     STATUS
 âˆ™ echo   PodInitializing
 ```

Keep executing the `tkn taskrun describe` command and you will eventually see that the pod status is `COMPLETED`.


Now look at the output of `TaskRun`

```
tkn taskrun logs echo-hello-world-task-run
```{{execute}}

You will see the log from the `echo` step

```
[echo] hello world
```

Hello Tekton!
