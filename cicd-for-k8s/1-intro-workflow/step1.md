# Prepare environment

Objective:


Prepare your local environment.

In this step, you will:
- Validate that the environment is initialized
- Set env vars with your GitHub and Docker Hub namespaces

## Validate environment initialization

Please wait until `Environment ready!` appears in the terminal window.

## Set environment variables

Your GitHub and Docker Hub namespaces (user or org names) will be needed in this scenario.
Copy and paste the following environment variables to the terminal window, then append the appropriate namespace:

```
# Provide your GitHub user or org name
GITHUB_NS=
```{{copy}}

```
# Provide your Docker Hub user or org name
IMG_NS=
```{{copy}}
