# Add a Trigger

Objective:

Up until this point youâ€™ve probably had this question pop up into your head: I can **manually** run my Tekton Pipeline, but how do I **automatically** run my pipeline?
Maybe you want to automatically run your pipeline every time you create a pull request, push code to a repo, or merge a pull request into the master branch.
Thankfully, the Tekton Triggers project solves this problem by automatically connecting events to your Tekton Pipelines.

In this step, you will:
- Learn about the components of Tekton Triggers and how they work

### Configure Tekton

Install the pipeline and trigger CRDs, and all the tasks we rely on.

```
kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.13.2/release.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/triggers/latest/release.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/v1beta1/git/git-clone.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/v1beta1/golang/lint.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/v1beta1/golang/tests.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/v1beta1/kaniko/kaniko.yaml
```{{execute}}

### Set up Git

You'll need your GitHub username to be able to push to this repo.
You can copy and paste the following command into the terminal window, then append your GitHub login:

```
# Fill this in with your GitHub login
GITHUB_USER=
```{{copy}}

Note: If your GitHub login is the same as the GitHub username or org which contains the `go-sample-app`, you can simply execute the following command instead.

```
GITHUB_USER=$GITHUB_NS
```{{execute}}

You will also need your GitHub access token to authenticate with the Git server.
You can copy and paste the following command into the terminal window, then append your GitHub login:

```
# Fill this in with your GitHub access token
GITHUB_TOKEN=
```{{copy}}

Use this token to create a new `Secret`.

```
kubectl create secret generic github-token --from-literal=GITHUB_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```{{execute}}

### Log into Docker Hub

Login to your Docker Hub account using the `docker` CLI (your username has to be lowercase):

```
docker login -u ${IMG_NS}
```{{execute}}

We can now create the registry `Secret`.

```
kubectl create secret generic regcred  --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=/root/.docker/config.json --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```{{execute}}

## Trigger workflow
Tekton Triggers adds mainly three new resource types to Kubernetes: the `EventListener`, the `TriggerBinding` and the `TriggerTemplate`.

An `EventListener` creates a Deployment and Service that listen for events.
When the `EventListener` receives an event, it executes a specified `TriggerBinding` and `TriggerTemplate`.
A `TriggerBinding` then describes what information you want to extract from an event to pass to your `TriggerTemplate`.
And finally, a `TriggerTemplate` declares a specification for each Kubernetes resource you want to create when an event is received.

Let's go through each of these resources and apply them to our existing Tekton `PipelineRun`.
